# Prediction-of-Weather-Parameters-Using-the-LSTM-Method
Weather is an important factor in human life. Fluctuating weather changes can have an impact on extreme weather conditions or climate change over a relatively long period of time. The importance of weather predictions for decision making and preventive actions to reduce risks related to weather changes in various aspects of life. This research aims to build the best prediction model on weather parameter data in Karimun Regency using the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method. Model building was carried out using a combination of hyperparameters determined by the researcher. The model that has the best performance is used to predict weather parameters for the next day. This research uses 8 parameters from Karimun Regency weather data. Based on the analysis results, it is known that each weather parameter has the best performance in different hyperparameter combinations. The RMSE value for the minimum temperature parameters is 0.8602, the maximum temperature is 1.1755, the average temperature is 0.8572, the average humidity is 3.8877, the rainfall is 15.0889, the duration of the sun is 2.7102, the maximum wind speed is 1.0090 and the average wind speed of 0.6740
